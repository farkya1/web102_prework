## Notes

I had trouble with the second part of the second challenge. For a long time I thought they were referring to the button id of all-btn. 
I figured it was referring to games-container with the help of the slack channel.

I thought all the rest of the challenges were fair and straight forward. I had a good grap of javascript and this was a good way
to get familiar with it once again before the start of the course.
